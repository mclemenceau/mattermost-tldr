# --- Channel selection (pick one approach) ---

# Option A: export every channel you are subscribed to.
# Channels are sorted by last activity; inactive ones (no posts in the period) are skipped
# automatically, so this is efficient even if you are in many channels.
# Can also be enabled at runtime with the --all-channels flag.
# When enabled, the channels list below is ignored.

# Option B: export a specific list of channels (used when all_channels is false).
# Use the channel name as it appears in the URL.
channels:
  - town-square
  - engineering
  - random

# Include direct messages and group messages in addition to channels.
# Can also be enabled at runtime with the --direct flag.
